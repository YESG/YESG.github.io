      <p>Providing monthly ration to people in need was the first project that YESG started to support which has now morphed into a corner stone mission for the organization.</p>
      <p>At a very young age founder of YESG and his sister visited orphanage and school for disabled kids to provide food, sweets and toys to them on their birthday with their grandfather.</p>
      <p>A need was identified where leprosy patients shunned by society could not find meaningful work and often went hungry. The early project started to provide steady supply of food provisions every month to the Leprosy patients living in a community outside Bhavnagar. The care package contains wheat (to make a bread called roti), rice, and dal (beans) and occasionally Sugar and or oil when a generous donor add to the monthly supply funds.</p>
      <p>As YESG got involved in helping patients of Dialysis and Chemo the project started incorporating those patients since they would miss work to get the treatment or their family members who miss work to help the patients while they get the treatment.</p>
      <p>As the Healthcare arm of YESG in Gujarat, India grew a need was identified to provide food to patients and family member’s coming to Bhavnagar to get treatment or surgeries. YESG supports local Meals on wheel program that delivers meals to patients and their family who are unable to afford to buy food while waiting for treatment. Volunteers pick up food from local resident families who fill the “Tiffin” and deliver them to the patients.</p>
      <p>Currently the provision project is managed by <strong>Shri Parshva Bhakti Charitable Trust</strong> that already provides helping hand to families living below poverty levels with food, medicine and education in Gujarat, India.</p>
